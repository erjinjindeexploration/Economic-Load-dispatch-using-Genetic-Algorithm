# Economic-Load-dispatch-using-Genetic-Algorithm
 An efficient optimization procedure based on genetic algorithm for the solution of economic load dispatch

Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is a phenomenon where an optimal combination of power generating units are selected so as to minimize the total fuel cost while satisfying the load demand & several operational constraints.


Total Cost of Poduction (C)=  Σ PiCi For Electric Demand of (D)


where,

Pi = real power output of Generator i (in MW),
D = total demand (in MW),
Ci = Cost Function for ith Generator


# Constraints

min_i ≤ Pi ≥ max_i

ΣPi = D

Plot may be changed everytime as most of the things in Genetic Algorithms are assigned randomly.
